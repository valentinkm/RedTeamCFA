# First Decision: Option 1 or 2

: DTG-18
Date: 02/11/2023
Status: In progress

# 1. Two unrelated research questions

- Goal: generalizability through “swapping” decisions of modularities.
- Structure:
    1. **Own**: Specifies Research Question as verbal descriptions with “general claims”. (e.g. in *small* models . in *large* models …)
    2. **Own**: Generates general design of simulation process leaving out realisations of predefined modularities. (e.g. *small:* = < 5 factors, ******large:****** ≥ 5 factors)
    3. **Other**: choosing realisations of modularities
    4. **Own**: choosing realisations of modularities
    5. **Own**: analyzing and interpreting results
    6. **Other**: analyzing and interpreting results
    7. ********************Together for each:******************** merging the two distinct simulations (only here increased generalizabitlity is gained?) (x2)


    | Collaborator 1 | Collaborator 2 |
    | --- | --- |
    | Question 1 | Question 2 |
    | Design 1 | Design 2 |
    | Realisations 2 | Realisations 1 |
    | Realisations 1 | Realisations 2 |
    | Merged Realisations 1 | Merged Realisations 1 |
    | Merged Realisations 2 | Merged Realisations 2 |
	|  Conclusion 1	|	Conclusion 2

	(additional swapping can be added)

- Does the generalizability really increase by delegating the decision or is it not as arbitrary and subjective within another mental model?
- Given the significant effort, will the added complexity be practically justified and presentable as a applicable research method?
- Also, it seems (in this general framework) another collaborator does hold zero stakes in making and arguing for certain decisions

# 2. One research topic with conflicting hypothese (true AC)

- Requires a controversial topic that allows to “take a side”
- Followed by role play with competing goals
- Multiple instances of classical AC
    - Planning & preregistration
    - Coding
    - Interpretation/ reporting
- Main challenge: identify suited topic
- 2 options for implentation details
    - Each have an existing paper as basis and doing one paper collaboratively
    - Each doing their own simulation first and do a collaborative third one together.
